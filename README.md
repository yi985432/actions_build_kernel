# actions_build_ErfanGSIs #

## This is a script for running erfangsi automatically based on GitHub actions. ##
## The steps are as follows： ##
### First of all, fork is the warehouse. ###
### Next, edit the file build ﹣ erfangsis.yml, and change the ROM ﹣ URL to the bottom package where you want to do GSI (note the direct link); and change the ROM ﹣ name to your ROM name. ###
### Then, press star to start! ###
### Finally, expand in the upload GSI, look at the download link link link, and visit to download. ###

## Note: due to the bug test when uploading artifacts, it was decided to change it to FQ for bitsend (bitsend. JP) uploaded to Japan. Please delete the previous fork and restart the fork ##
